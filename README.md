# Linkumori (URLs Purifier)

![Linkumori](https://github.com/subham8907/Linkumori/blob/main/icons/icon48.png)

Linkumori (URLs Purifier) is a powerful browser extension for Chromium-based browsers that enhances your privacy by purifying URLs, removing tracking parameters, and blocking hyperlink auditing, all without interrupting your browsing experience.

**Note:** This project is currently under construction and is a fork of UTM Eraser (Eraser). 

## Features

- Cleans URLs by removing tracking parameters without blocking or redirecting
- Utilizes both static and dynamic Declarative Net Request (DNR) rules for efficient URL cleaning at the network level
- Supports a wide range of websites and URL patterns
- Blocks hyperlink auditing for increased privacy
- Uses the History API to update URLs without page reloads
- Operates seamlessly in the background

## How It Works

1. **Static DNR rules**: Predefined rules that clean common tracking parameters across various websites.
2. **Dynamic DNR rules**: Allows for more flexible and up-to-date URL cleaning based on the latest tracking methods.
3. **History API**: For URLs that can't be caught by DNR rules, Linkumori uses the History API to clean the URL without reloading the page.
4. **Hyperlink Auditing Block**: Prevents websites from tracking your clicks on links that leave their site.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code to a permanent location (do not delete the folder after installation).
2. Open your Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge) and navigate to the extensions page.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.

## Usage

Once installed, Linkumori works automatically in the background:

1. The extension icon in the browser toolbar shows the current status.
2. Click the icon to toggle the extension on or off.
3. Browse normally - Linkumori will clean URLs as you navigate, without any noticeable interruption to your browsing.

## Configuration

Linkumori uses configuration files to determine which parameters to remove from URLs:

- `rules/et_1` to `rules/et_8`: Static DNR rules
- `default.json`: Dynamic DNR rules
- `Artifact.json`: Additional URL cleaning patterns for the History API method

Advanced users can modify these files to customize the extension's behavior.
