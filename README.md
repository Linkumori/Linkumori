Linkumori (URLs Cleaner) is a powerful browser extension for Chromium-based browsers that enhances your privacy by purifying URLs, removing tracking parameters, and blocking hyperlink auditing, all without interrupting your browsing experience.

## Features

- Cleans URLs by removing tracking parameters without blocking or redirecting
- Utilizes both static and dynamic Declarative Net Request (DNR) rules for efficient URL cleaning at the network level 
- Supports a wide range of websites and URL patterns
- Blocks hyperlink auditing for increased privacy
- Uses the History API to update URLs without page reloads
- Operates seamlessly in the background 
- Supports dark/light mode theme toggle
- Advanced tools interface for additional functionality

## How It Works

1. **Static DNR rules**: Predefined rules that clean common tracking parameters across various websites.
2. **Dynamic DNR rules**: Allows for more flexible and up-to-date URL cleaning based on the latest tracking methods.
3. **History API**: For URLs that can't be caught by DNR rules, Linkumori uses the History API to clean the URL without reloading the page.
4. **Hyperlink Auditing Block**: Prevents websites from tracking your clicks on links that leave their site.

## Installation 

### Load unpacked: Chrome, MS Edge or Brave (all desktop)

1. Clone this repository or download the source code to a permanent location (do not delete the folder after installation).
2. Open your Chromium-based browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge) and navigate to the extensions page. 
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.

### CRX-file: other Chromium browsers (Opera/Vivaldi/Yandex)

1. Download the extension as a crx-file from latest release (right-click > save link as).
2. In your browser navigate to the extensions page 
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Drag your crx-file anywhere on the page to import it.

## Usage

Once installed, Linkumori works automatically in the background:

1. The extension icon in the browser toolbar shows the current status.
2. Click the icon to toggle the extension on or off.
3. Browse normally - Linkumori will clean URLs as you navigate, without any noticeable interruption to your browsing.
4. Use the theme toggle to switch between dark and light modes.
5. Access advanced tools through the dedicated button in the interface.

## Whitelisting System

Linkumori includes a domain whitelisting system that allows you to exempt specific domains from URL cleaning. However, the domain matching requires careful attention to the domain format.

### Domain Matching Rules:
1. For URLs with `www` prefix (e.g. `www.example.com`):
   - Can whitelist as `www.example.com` OR `example.com` 
   - Both formats will work
2. For URLs without `www` prefix (e.g. `example.com`):
   - Must whitelist exactly as `example.com`
   - Using `www.example.com` will NOT work
3. For subdomains (e.g. `sub.example.com`):
   - Must whitelist exactly as `sub.example.com`

### Usage Examples:
✅ Correct Usage:
- For `https://www.example.com`:
  - Can use `www.example.com` OR `example.com` 
- For `https://example.com`:
  - Must use `example.com`
- For `https://sub.example.com`:
  - Must use `sub.example.com`

❌ Incorrect Usage:
- For `https://example.com`:
  - Using `www.example.com` won't work

### Best Practices:
1. Check the actual URL in your browser's address bar
2. For sites with `www`, you can use either format
3. For sites without `www`, must match exactly  
4. For subdomains, always match exactly
5. Test the whitelist entry by visiting different pages on the domain
