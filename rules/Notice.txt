# Fourth Modification - Rule System Restructuring
Modified by Subham Mahesh

## Overview
This modification involved a comprehensive restructuring of our rule system. The previous implementation contained rules from two distinct sources, which have now been consolidated into a more streamlined format.

## Previous Structure
The files contained:
1. Declarative NetRequest static rules converted by Subham Mahesh from AdGuard's MV2 extension filter lists (originally developed by AdGuard Software Ltd.) - rules12.json, rules4-7.json
2. Independent URL parameter cleaning rules developed by Subham Mahesh - rules1-3.json, rules8.json, rules11.json

## New Structure
All previous files have been replaced with a new set of consolidated rule files (rules1.json through rules6.json). These new files contain:
- Declarative NetRequest static rules converted from AdGuard's MV2 filter lists
- Additional Declarative NetRequest static rules independently developed by Subham Mahesh

## File Changes
### Removed Files
- AdGuard-derived conversions: rules12.json, rules4-7.json
- Subham Mahesh's original rules: rules1-3.json, rules8.json, rules11.json

### Added Files
- New consolidated files: rules1.json through rules6.json
