"This modification converts Adguard tracking parameter filters to Chrome Declarative Net Request (DNR) rule format. The original filter list comes from AdguardTeam's TrackParamFilter repository (specifically from /sections/specific.txt). The conversion splits the rules across multiple JSON files: rules4.json, rules5.json, rules6.json, and rules7.json."
